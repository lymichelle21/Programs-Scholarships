# Programs+

Programs+ is a hub for scholarships and free programs. At Programs+, our mission is to expand opportunities to underrepresented and underserved communities by serving as an easily accessible database for scholarships and free programs. We hope that by centralizing a location to find opportunities that are sortable by subject, we can encourage people of all backgrounds to pursue their passions and overall promote diversity and inclusion in all fields.
